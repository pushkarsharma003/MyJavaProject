        Quikr is all about you - Our aim is to empower every person in the country to independently 
        connect with buyers and sellers online. Brainchild of Pranay Chulet, Quikr is widely known 
        as India's no. 1 online classifieds platform - and there's a reason behind that. We care 
        about you - and the transactions that bring you closer to your dreams. Want to buy your 
        first car? We're here for you. Want to sell commercial property to buy a home for your family? 
        We're here for you. Whatever job you've got, we promise to get it done.
        <br>
        Founded in 2008 and headquartered in Bangalore, Quikr has left a memorable footprint in 
        over 1000 cities. And we continue to work towards building the future of trading and e-commerce.
        <h3>Ushering in the new age of Quikr</h3>
        
        In July 2015, we changed our brand identity to reflect who we are - dynamic, flexible and ready 
        to adapt to the spirit of the contemporary Indian audience. In addition to that, we recently appointed actors 
        Ranveer Singh and Suriya as our brand ambassadors. We've also launched Quikr Cars - venturing into the diverse 
        range of automobiles i.e. cars, motorbikes and commercial vehicles.
        Our idea is to consistently keep adding something game-changing and worthwhile to your Quikr experience - whether it is 
        QuikrNXT, the freedom to buy or sell without risking 
        your privacy, or the missed call service, to give Quikr access to the masses who aren't 
        online today but would have internet access in the near future.
